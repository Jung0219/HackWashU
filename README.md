### Abstract
The AI-Powered Healthcare Price Transparency Navigator (TransparAI)  is a platform that merges real-time computer vision with hospital price transparency. By guiding users through wound image classification and localized cost comparison, the solution empowers patients to find affordable care and make informed decisions, addressing the prompt to unite people and AI for social benefit.

### User Experience
The system is user-centric, requiring only a wound photo and zip code entry + non-invasive insurance information. The interface provides intuitive, side-by-side, real world hospital price comparisons, highlighting cost savings for each provider. Results are presented clearly, offering users quick and actionable insights.

### Functional Prototype
The working demo maps wound images (classified by a deep neural network) to standard billing codes and instantly queries a real-time database of hospital service prices. The backend efficiently processes data using a Flask REST API, compressing gigabyte-scale datasets into rapid, user-facing lookups. Users can test the platform’s full functionality, from image upload to price comparison and insurance cost estimation
